The OSI Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking protocols and technologies interact in a computer network. It consists of seven layers and is organized from the lowest level (Layer 1) dealing with physical connections to the highest level (Layer 7) dealing with application-level interactions.

What it is: The OSI Model is a reference model that helps in understanding and designing computer networks by breaking down network communication into distinct layers.

How many layers it has: The OSI Model consists of seven layers, namely: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

How it is organized: The model is organized in a hierarchical manner, with each layer having specific functions and interactions with adjacent layers.

What is a LAN: A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that covers a small geographical area, typically within a single building or campus. It allows connected devices to communicate with each other locally.

Typical usage: LANs are commonly used in homes, offices, and educational institutions for sharing resources and enabling local communication.

Typical geographical size: LANs typically cover a small area, such as a home, office building, or campus.

What is a WAN: A WAN (Wide Area Network) is a network that spans a larger geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs or remote locations.

Typical usage: WANs are used to connect geographically dispersed networks or provide internet connectivity to remote sites.

Typical geographical size: WANs can cover large regions, even spanning continents, to connect distant locations.

What is the Internet: The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks that allows worldwide communication and access to information and services.

What is an IP address: An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network, enabling them to be identified and communicate with each other.

What are the 2 types of IP address: The two types of IP addresses are IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit) addresses.

What is localhost: "Localhost" refers to the loopback address (IP address 127.0.0.1) and is used to establish network connections with the device itself.

What is a subnet: A subnet is a smaller, logically segmented network within a larger network, often used for organizational purposes or to manage IP address allocation.

Why IPv6 was created: IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide a vastly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of internet-connected devices.

TCP/UDP: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two main transport layer protocols used for data transfer within IP networks.

Main difference between TCP and UDP: TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and retransmission, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication without guaranteed reliability.

What is a port: A port is a 16-bit number used to identify a specific process or service on a device in network communications.

Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers: SSH uses port 22, HTTP uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443.

What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network: The Ping tool or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is commonly used to check the connectivity of devices on a network by sending echo requests and receiving responses.
